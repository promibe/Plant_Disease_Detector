Plant Disease Detection System

Developed a deep learning-based system to detect plant diseases and identify the type of plant and disease. The system utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify plant diseases into 39 classes, each with over 2,000 datasets.

Key Features:
1. Deep Learning Model: Utilized CNN architecture with convolutional and activation layers.
2. Multi-Class Classification: Classified plant diseases into 39 classes.
3. Large Dataset: Trained on a substantial dataset with over 2,000 images per class.
4. High Accuracy: Achieved over 95% accuracy in plant disease detection.

Technical Details:
1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Leveraged CNNs for image classification.
2. Dataset Split: Utilized training, testing, and validation datasets for model development.

Skills Demonstrated:
1. Deep Learning
2. Image Classification
3. CNN Architecture
4. Data Preprocessing
5. Model Evaluation
